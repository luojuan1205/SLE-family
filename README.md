# SLE-family
This repository contains data for paper "Screening of SLE-Susceptible SNPs in one Chinese Family with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus". The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and some of statistical analysis data of the SLE family used in our manuscript are shown below. 

File 1:patient-specific SNPs that occurred in all three patients but not in healthy control.

File 2:healthy-specific SNPs that occurred in healthy control but not in any of three patients.

File 3:patient-specific SNPs that located in a conservative area and their phastCons conservative scores.

File 4:healthy-specific SNPs that located in a conservative area and their phastCons conservative scores.

File 5:patient-specific SNPs which were eQTLs.

File 6:patient-specific SNPs that located in RNA-binding sites.

File 7:patient-specific SNPs that located in RBP(RNA-binding protein)-binding sites.
