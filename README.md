# SLE-family
The single nucleotide polymorphisms and some of statistical analysis data of this SLE family used in this manuscript are stored here. 
The following is the description of each file.
file 1:patient-specific SNPs that occurred in all three patients but not in healthy control.
file 2:healthy-specific SNPs that occurred in healthy control but not in any of three patients.
file 3:patient-specific SNPs that located in a conservative area and it's phastCons conservative scores.
file 4:healthy-specific SNPs that located in a conservative area and it's phastCons conservative scores.
file 5:patient-specific SNPs which was eQTL.
file 6:patient-specific SNPs that located in RNA-binding sites.
file 7:patient-specific SNPs that located in RBP(RNA-binding protein)-binding sites.
